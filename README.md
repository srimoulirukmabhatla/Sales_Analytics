### [Business Request](https://github.com/srimoulirukmabhatla/Sales_Analytics/blob/main/Business%20Request.docx)  
-  We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to move from static reports to **visual dashboards**.  
-  Essentially, we want to focus it on how much we have sold of what **products**, to which clients and how it has been over time.  
-  Seeing as each **sales person works** on different **products and customers** it would be beneficial to be able to filter them also.  
-  We measure our **numbers against budget** so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against **performance**.   
-  The **budget is for 2021** and we usually look **2 years back in time** when we do analysis of sales.
